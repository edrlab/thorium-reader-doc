Depending on your configuration and whether or not you use a screen reader, it is possible that only one of these two combinations works.\n The table of contents The table of contents represents the architecture of the book as defined by the book\u0026rsquo;s producing organization.\nThe first level titles are indicated without margin, those with subtitles (or second level title) are presented with a lightgray background. The sub-headings are shifted from the margin to the left and a vertical line makes it easy to know to which level of title they belong.\nWith NVDA You can use the title level navigation functions (NVDA + H) to explore and move through the table of contents.      Landmarks Good-quality digital books have markers that allow you to identify and quickly reach the main parts of a book.\nInformation\nEach EPUB publication should include a guide to all major landmarks. The titles of the landmarks are at the discretion of the publisher choice, but the nature of each landmark must be identified according to a semantic vocabulary. The main ones are:\n Main text (bodymatter) Table of contents (toc) bibliography index glossary  The complete list of semantic vocabulary EPUB in English is available on the W3C website.\n    Attention !\nPDF bookmarks used to compensate for the lack of a table of contents in this format are not interpreted by Thorium.\nUnlike Landmarks, Bookmarks are made for users who want to place a mark into a book.\n The reference pages Digital books can have a reference pagination allowing correspondence to the pagination of the printed book.\nThere is a navigation option to go to the page. When you access it, this option shows the current page.\nThere is also a keyboard shortcut for this function. Press the Ctrl + Shift + P, then enter the page number in the edit box by typing it or changing the value using the Go to page box.\n   Attention !\nAdapted books sometimes use the reference pagination to offer a regular book breakdown to readers without reproducing the pagination of the original pagination.

Textual content is formatted in XHTML 1 and no multimedia feature is supported. EPUB 2 ebooks are still accessible if properly formatted.    EPUB 3  this is the recommended format for the 21st century. Textual content is formatted in (X)HTML 5, it is possible to create fixed-layout ebooks, enriched ebooks and accessibiltiy features are well designed.    DAISY v2.02 / v3 (text, audio, text+audio).    PDF  despite a well-known lack of flexibility (no reflow option) and accessibility, many ebooks are still available in PDF only, especially in public libraries.    Audiobooks  a standardized format for audiobookshas been designed by the W3C Publishing Working Group in 2020, and EDRLab was part of this WG. Thorium is supporting the packaged (LPF) audiobook format, which will soon be widely used by booksellers, or so we hope.    Visual narratives  EDRLab has designed a standard format for comics, manga, webtoons and other styles of digital works based on sequances of images. Divina is the name of this format. This is still an experimental format, and we hope that publishers will size it in 2021+.
