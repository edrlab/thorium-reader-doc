# Reading PDFs

Thorium PDF reading engine relies on pdf.js a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5. PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla.

## Navigation features for PDFs

Navigation in PDF can always be done with the go to page panel. Additionally, when PDFs creators have included Document Outline, those are available thru the Table Of Content Navigation Panel. That's a different behavior of what is done by acrobat reader that displays Document Outlines as Bookmarks and allows users to manipulate them by changing order, renaming, adding and deleting them. 

With Thorium Reader, you can safely add your own bookmarks and you will find them in the Bookmarks navigation panel.

## Bookmarks and annotations for PDFs

At this moment, annotations are not available for PDFs. Bookmarks are fully implemented and can be created and navigated as detailled in the [Reading action bookmarks chapter](../230_bookmarks/index.xhtml). 

An attention point here is that only one bookmark per page can be added. Trying to add more than one bookmark per page will remove the existing one.

## Printing PDF

Since 3.2, it is possible to print page ranges of a PDF. This can be limited by LCP rules decided by the vendor or lender.

##Â PDF keyboard shortcuts

PDF.js adds keyboard shortcuts that are not configurable in the Thorium setting panel. The list reproduced here is non exhaustive and some shortcuts may not work. It is copied from the [PDF.JS Frequently Asked Questions page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#what-are-the-pdfjs-keyboard-shortcuts).
