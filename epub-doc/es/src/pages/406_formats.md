## Supported publication formats

EPUB 2
:   this is a legacy format, only adequate for basic ebooks. Textual
    content is formatted in XHTML 1 and no multimedia feature is
    supported. EPUB 2 ebooks are still accessible if properly formatted.

EPUB 3
:   this is the recommended format for the 21st century. Textual content
    is formatted in (X)HTML 5, it is possible to create fixed-layout
    ebooks, enriched ebooks and accessibiltiy features are well
    designed.

DAISY v2.02 / v3
:   (text, audio, text+audio).

PDF
:   despite a well-known lack of flexibility (no reflow option) and
    accessibility, many ebooks are still available in PDF only,
    especially in public libraries.

Audiobooks
:   a [standardized format for
    audiobooks](https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/) has been designed by
    the W3C Publishing Working Group in 2020, and EDRLab was part of
    this WG. Thorium is supporting the [packaged
    (LPF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/) audiobook format, which will soon
    be widely used by booksellers, or so we hope.

Visual narratives
:   EDRLab has designed a standard format for comics, manga, webtoons
    and other styles of digital works based on sequances of images.
    [Divina](https://www.edrlab.org/open-standards/) is the name of this
    format. This is still an experimental format, and we hope that
    publishers will size it in 2021+.
