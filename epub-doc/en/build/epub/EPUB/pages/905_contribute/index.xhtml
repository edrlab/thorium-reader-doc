    <p>Thorium and its documentation are developed thanks to the user
community. We need help to translate this documentation.</p>
    <p>To do so, you can 
      <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/contact/">contact us</a>.
    </p>
    <p>If you are comfortable enough with GitHub and the Markdown format you
can propose a new translation via a Pull Request.</p>
    <p>To do this: clone the repository and create a branch with the name of
the language you want to add, make a copy of the 
      <code>content.en</code> folder and
rename it with two letters corresponding to the language you want to add
(for example 
      <code>content.es</code> will contain the Spanish translation). The
names of the files must not be changed as they insure correspondence
between languages.
    </p>
    <p>The 
      <code>i18n</code> folder contains the translations for the fixed elements of
the header and footer. Several languages are already present, if your
language is not present, copy paste the .yaml file and rename it with
the first two letters of the letters of the language you want to add.
    </p>
    <p>Finally to activate the menu of the language you add, edit the file

      <code>config.toml</code> and add the language with the following code:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>      [languages.en]
  languageName = 'English'
  contentDir = 'content.en'
  weight = 1
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>You must replace

      <code>.en' with the first two letters of the language you are adding and fill in the name of the language as the </code>languageName

      <code>value. The</code>weight` indicates the order of appearance in the language
menu.
    </p>
    <p>Example for Spanish :</p>
    <pre>
      <code>      [languages.es]
  languageName = 'Espa√±ol'
  contentDir = 'content.es'
  weight = 3
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>Localized images such as screenshots should be added to the folder

      <code>statics/images/local-(two letter language)</code>.
    </p>
