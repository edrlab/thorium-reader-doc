    <h2 id="read_images_zoom">Zooming on images</h2>
    <p>Thorium has an image zoom feature (epub only).</p>
    <p>To zoom on an image you can select the image (a magenta focus outline
will appear around it) and activate zoom by clicking with the mouse or
tapping it with the finger. Access to image zoom via keyboard is
currently not possible.</p>
    <p>If the image is also a link or if the book your read is in a fixed
layout format, you will need to hit the [Shift]{.kbd} key in order to
enter the image zoom feature.</p>
    <p>To zoom in or out, tab to the 
      <code>+</code> or 
      <code>-</code> buttons and hit [enter]{.kbd},
use mouse wheel, scroll up and down or pinch and stretch trackpad or
onscreen touch gestures.
    </p>
    <p>Once the image is zoomed you can move vertically and horizontally with
[Left arrow]{.kbd}, [Right arrow]{.kbd}, [Left arrow]{.kbd} and [Right
arrow]{.kbd}, by moving mouse while maintaining clic, with usual
trackpad gestures or with finger moves on tactile screens.</p>
    <p>To close the image zoom view and to return to the reading view, press
[ESC]{.kbd} key, or the X button.</p>
    <p>Some restrictions due to ebook design may apply, for example when images
are inserted as style (CSS), it is not possible to open the image view
for zooming.</p>
