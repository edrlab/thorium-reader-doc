book. The main window is always open and offers 4 views (Home, All
books, Catalogs and General settings) while book windows views will
depend on the book format (textual, audio, visual). Each format will
allow a selection of action panels that can be docked to one side of the
view.</p>

pages are like Shelves or stacks as the All publication view is limited

    <h3 id="catalog_view">Catalogs View</h3>
    <p>This is the place where you can store, access, browse online catalogs
and acquire or borrow ebooks from them. At first this place will sound
empty because we do not preload any catalog. The 
      <em>online additional
support 
        <a href="https://thorium.edrlab.org/th3/get_ebooks/">Where to get
ebooks?</a>
      </em> section can help
you identify available catalogs if you do not already have one in mind.
    </p>
    <p>Two catalogs protocoles are available.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="https://opds.io/">OPDS</a>, a standard format to display catalog on
the Web. Thorium can provide access to OPDS 1 and 2 catalogs.
      </li>

but not identical).</li>

    <h3 id="setting_view">Application Settings Panel</h3>
    <p>Application settings is divided in three tabs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The General Tab allow you to select the language of the interface
and to Save session (meaning that the application will remember the
windows opened at closing and reopen them when launched again). The
[clear login data]{.ui_button} button will delete any Catalog
authentification previously stored (useful if you are reading on a
public or shared computer or if you want to change the account with
wich you are connected).</li>
      <li>The Appearance Tab let you choose the application Theme (dark, light
or automatic to fit the system preference).</li>
      <li>The Keyboard shortcuts Tab help you check and manipulate keyboard
driven actions within the application. Figure out the three dots
menu aside of the Panel title with extra actions (Reset, Edit and
Load). The Edit one opens system folder application to the
localisation of the stored user setting .json file, allowing you to
edit it outside of the application (at your own risks), save it for
future uses or share it within your devices or with who you want.
