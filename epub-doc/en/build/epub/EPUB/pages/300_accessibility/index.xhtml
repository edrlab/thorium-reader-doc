    <p>Thorium Reader is for everyone, including people who are blind or have
other types of visual, cognitive or motor disabilities. The application
is compatible with accessible technologies like screen readers,
including JAWS, NVDA, Narrator and VoiceOver. It includes a read-aloud
feature with visual highlighting. Thorium Reader can be used with the
mouse or the keyboard, and keyboard shortcuts are configurable. The
display can be customized to meet the needs of users, including colors,
text size, spacing, font and layout.</p>
