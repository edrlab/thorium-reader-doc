    <h2>Reading with a screen reader</h2>
    <p>When launching Thorium, if a screen reader is detected, the relative
functions are activated.</p>
    <p>Note that screen readers use a separate buffer to access the HTML
content which results in the visual scroll / page offset to be out of
sync. In other words, Thorium is generally not aware of the user's
current reading location inside the screen reader buffer, unless the
screen reader user triggers standard web API events (such as mouse click
anywhere in the text, or keyboard tab into focusable HTML elements).</p>
    <p>::: warning
Attention !</p>
    <p>Accessibility features addressed to assistive technologies are strongly
affected by the quality of the book files.
