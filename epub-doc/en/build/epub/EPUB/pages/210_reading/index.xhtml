or full Daisy will allow for the greatest number of functionalities.</li>

not allow personalization of texts.</li>

        <h2 id="zen_and_full">Zen Mode and Full screen </h2>
        <p>Thorium reading windows offers a distraction free &quot;zen&quot; mode that hides all icons other than the fullscreen icon button itself, and the &quot;skip to content&quot; blue link in the upper corner (reachable via keyboard tab).</p>
        <p>Navigation in zen mode is only possible with keyboard arrows and shortcuts. Touch screen support is not guaranteed so finger swipe interactions may not work.</p>
        <p>The alternative Fullscreen mode can be launched with keyboard shortcut

          <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + 
          <kbd>F11</kbd>. In this mode, the user interface buttons such as top buttons, side arrows and bottom left jump back and forward icons.

        <h2 id="read_search">Search in a book</h2>
        <p>You can use 
          <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + 
          <kbd>F</kbd> keys to access the search field.
Enter your search term. By clicking on the 
          <code>Search</code> button, you get

          <code>Back</code> and 
          <code>Next</code> buttons to navigate between occurences. The number of
matches found is a link that will open a 
          <code>List of results</code> in the right
panel. Each match displayed is a link you can Activate to go to the
place of the book where the expression you are looking for was found.
        </p>
        <p>warning
Remember that performing a search and navigating thru the results will
make you loose the reading point you where at. Just place a Bookmark to
make sure you find your way back.</p>
