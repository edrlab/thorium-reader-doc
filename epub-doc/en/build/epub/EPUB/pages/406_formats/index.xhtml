      <h2>Supported publication formats</h2>
      <p>EPUB 2
:   this is a legacy format, only adequate for basic ebooks. Textual
content is formatted in XHTML 1 and no multimedia feature is
supported. EPUB 2 ebooks are still accessible if properly formatted.</p>
      <p>EPUB 3
:   this is the recommended format for the 21st century. Textual content
is formatted in (X)HTML 5, it is possible to create fixed-layout
ebooks, enriched ebooks and accessibiltiy features are well
designed.</p>
      <p>DAISY v2.02 / v3
:   (text, audio, text+audio).</p>
      <p>PDF
:   despite a well-known lack of flexibility (no reflow option) and
accessibility, many ebooks are still available in PDF only,
especially in public libraries.</p>
      <p>Audiobooks
:   a 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/">standardized format for
audiobooks</a> has been designed by
the W3C Publishing Working Group in 2020, and EDRLab was part of
this WG. Thorium is supporting the 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/">packaged
(LPF)</a> audiobook format, which will soon
be widely used by booksellers, or so we hope.
      </p>
      <p>Visual narratives
:   EDRLab has designed a standard format for comics, manga, webtoons
and other styles of digital works based on sequances of images.

        <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/open-standards/">Divina</a> is the name of this
format. This is still an experimental format, and we hope that
publishers will size it in 2021+.
