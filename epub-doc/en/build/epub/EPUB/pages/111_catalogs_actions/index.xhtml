    <h2>Setting up a french public library account</h2>
    <p>In France, many public libraries provide a machine-readable catalog
(similar to OPDS but not identical), letting patrons download digital
publications from their personal bookshelf. Integrating this technology
in Thorium Reader allows you to download an ebook or audiobook directly
into Thorium Reader for instant reading.</p>
    <p>To connect your French public library account, enter a French city
('Montpellier') or part of the library name in the Search field and
hit the Search button. A list of public libraries corresponding to your
search will appear. Select a library and hit Add. In the updated list of
catalogs, select this library: an authentication form is displayed.
Enter your username/email address and password, and hit Login. You can
now see the content of your personal bookshelf, from which you can
download and read the ebooks and audiobooks you previously borrowed.</p>
