    search. `Results` will display instantly. The search is performed
    thru the books informations including user added tags. The content
    of the book is not included in the search. To perform a search
    inside book content you have to open the book and activate the
    Search in a book function.

    that have been added to publications. This box is a text free input
    that will filter the list of available Tags.

    column headings (Title, Author, Progression, remaining days for
    loans, main publication languages, Tags, Format, Last reading date,
    Publisher name, Published date, DRM protection, Duration for
    audiobooks, Description, and Accessibility conformance). For filters
    to work, the information must be present in the publication
    metadata.

    publications. If you have more ebooks than that, they will be
    available thru different pages that can be considered like Shelves
    or stacks.
