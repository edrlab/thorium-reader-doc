# Forewords

Thorium is a digital book reader, it is also a library where you can
store your books and access to online catalogs.

Thorium allows to read ebooks in different [formats](../406_formats/index.xhtml),
each of them having strengths and limitations. This documentation is
provided as an EPUB, the format with the larger number of
functionalities.

This software is free, open-source and as such, its development is only
possible because it is funded by different organizations. Among these,
members of EDRLab, private or public grants and small recurring
donations from happy users (individuals or companies). If you rely on
this application, consider [support!](../903_support/index.xhtml)

## This is the documentation for Thorium 3, and it is a work in progress! {#th3}

Thorium 3 introduces numerous changes and, we hope, a friction less
reading experience. This documentation is a work in progress trying to
support new users discovering the software as well as providing the
missing links for the experimented readers.
