## This is the documentation for Thorium 3, and it is a work in progress! {#th3}

Thorium 3 introduces numerous changes and, we hope, a friction less
reading experience. This documentation is a work in progress trying to
support new users discovering the software as well as providing the
missing links for the experimented readers.

This user guide limits itself to providing details on features and actions. Aside from it you'll find dedicated ressources in the app itself or on the <a href="https://thorium.edrlab.org/en/th3/"><span>online support webpages </span></a>

## Supported publication formats

Thorium Reader Desktop supports diff√©rent publication formats. Each format coming with particularities, it is not always possible to offer the same features for all. 

* EPUB (Electronic PUBlication) is an open file format for electronic publications. EPUB is a native semantic format allowing to use numerous standardised languages such as HTML, ARIA, MATHML, SVG and others. The actual version 3 is known to provide the best up to date reading experience. Obsolete EPUB2 files are also readable in Thorium.

* DAISY Usually produced and distributed by specialized libraries or NGOs, the DAISY format offers a significantly enhanced reading experience for ebooks that are not available in EPUB3. Thorium supports reading DAISY 3 and 2.02, both in their text only, audio only, and syncronised text and audio.

* PDF (Portable Document Format) is a fixed layout format reproducing the printed reading experience.

* Audiobooks a standardized format for audiobooks has been designed by the W3C Publishing Working Group in 2020, and EDRLab was part of this WG. Thorium is supporting the packaged (LPF) audiobook format, which will soon be widely used by booksellers, or so we hope.

* Visual narratives, a standard format for comics, manga, webtoons and other styles of digital works based on sequences of images. Divina is the name of this format. This is still an experimental format.

## Keyboard functions {#keyboard}

Each key combination can be changed in Thorium 
[Application Setting Panel](../102_windows_views_panels/index.xhtml#setting_view). 
Figure out the three dots menu aside of the Panel title with extra actions 
(Reset, Edit and Load). The Edit one opens system folder application to the
localisation of the stored user setting `.json` file, allowing you to
edit it outside of the application (at your own risks) 
or save it for future uses or share it within your devices or with who you want.

Since 3.2, it is possible to filter actions through a search box to ease finding keyboard shortcuts.

The default setup is available online at support page <a href="https://thorium.edrlab.org/en/th3/400_ressources/402_keyboard-shortcuts/"><span>Keyboard shortcuts</span></a>
