# Before using Thorium Reader Desktop

This user guide limits itself to providing details on features and actions. Aside from it you'll find dedicated ressources in the app itself or on the <a href="https://thorium.edrlab.org/en/th3/"><span>online support webpages </span></a>

## Supported publication formats

Thorium Reader Desktop supports diff√©rent publication formats. Each format coming with particularities, it is not always possible to offer the same features for all. 

* EPUB (Electronic PUBlication) is an open file format for electronic publications. EPUB is a native semantic format allowing to use numerous standardised languages such as HTML, ARIA, MATHML, SVG and others. The actual version 3 is known to provide the best up to date reading experience. Obsolete EPUB2 files are also readable in Thorium.

* DAISY Usually produced and distributed by specialized libraries or NGOs, the DAISY format offers a significantly enhanced reading experience for ebooks that are not available in EPUB3. Thorium supports reading DAISY 3 and 2.02, both in their text only, audio only, and syncronised text and audio.

* PDF despite a well-known lack of flexibility (no reflow option) and accessibility, many ebooks are still available in PDF only, especially in public libraries.

* Audiobooks a standardized format for audiobooks has been designed by the W3C Publishing Working Group in 2020, and EDRLab was part of this WG. Thorium is supporting the packaged (LPF) audiobook format, which will soon be widely used by booksellers, or so we hope.

* Visual narratives, a standard format for comics, manga, webtoons and other styles of digital works based on sequences of images. Divina is the name of this format. This is still an experimental format.


## Keyboard functions {#keyboard}

Each key combination can be changed in Thorium [Application Setting Panel](../102_windows_views_panels/index.xhtml#setting_view). Figure out the three dots
menu aside of the Panel title with extra actions (Reset, Edit and
Load). The Edit one opens system folder application to the
localisation of the stored user setting .json file, allowing you to
edit it outside of the application (at your own risks), print it to stick it along your screen or save it for
future uses or share it within your devices or with who you want.

The default setup is available online at support page <a href="https://thorium.edrlab.org/en/th3/400_ressources/402_keyboard-shortcuts/"><span>Keyboard shortcuts</span></a>

# Opening Thorium Reader {#getabook}

Once Thorium reader is installed on your system, severals ways are
possible to open it.

-   Thorium can be launched from the application menu or from any
    shortcut created. This action will open the [library home
    view]() and will allow you to choose a book or to add
    one but also to access to [catalogs]() and organize your
    collection. To read a book just click on it or validate with
    <kbd>Enter</kbd> when selected.
-   Select the book you want to read, use the `contextual menu` (right
    click), select `open with` and then select `Thorium`.
-   You can set the default application for certain file types through
    the Windows settings. Select a file, open the context menu, select
    `Open with`, in the pop-up window select `Thorium`, check the box
    `Always open with`. This operation must be repeated for each file
    format you wish to read with Thorium.
