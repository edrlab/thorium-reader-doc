# Reading

Thorium provides textual, visual and auditory reading functions. In
order to ensure that you can find your way around the the publication,
Thorium also offers many navigation options as well as the possibility
to add bookmarks or to search within the publication.

Reading functionalities are very different from one format to another.

-   Reading Textual first publications like reflowable EPUB and textual
    or full Daisy will allow for the greatest number of functionalities.
-   Visual first publications like Fixed Layout EPUBS and Divina will
    not allow personalization of texts.
-   Audio publications have a significative different reading interface
    as no text is displayed.
-   PDF support is basic and provides few options.


## Zen Mode and Full screen  {#zen_and_full}

Thorium reading windows offers a distraction free "zen" mode that hides all icons other than the fullscreen icon button itself, and the "skip to content" blue link in the upper corner (reachable via keyboard tab). 

Navigation in zen mode is only possible with keyboard arrows and shortcuts. Touch screen support is not guaranteed so finger swipe interactions may not work.

The alternative Fullscreen mode can be launched with keyboard shortcut 
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F11</kbd>. In this mode, the user interface buttons such as top buttons, side arrows and bottom left jump back and forward icons.
