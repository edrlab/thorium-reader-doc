# Annotations

*Annotations have been introduced first in Thorium 3, as a new feature,
it may present unexpected behaviors. Let us know any difficulty you face
by opening an issue or sending us an email.*

The simplest way to add an annotation is to select a text and hit the
Annotations button
(<img src="../../resources/images/icons3/annotation-icon.svg" class="icon" role="presentation"/>) or stroke the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>. This opens the Annotation pop up
and place the cursor into the input box where you can write your
annotation (optional). You can change highlight color and type (Solid
background, Underline, Strikethrough or Outline) then validate the
creation of the annotation with <span class="ui_button">Save</span>.

## Annotations panel {#annotations_panel}

At the bottom of the navigation panel, there\'s a section dedicated to
Annotations. It allows you to review, manipulate and navigate thru your
annotations.

For options are available from this Panel:

-   Instant mode will open the Annotation pop up at each selection.
-   Quick create Highlights the select text and create an empty
    annotation.
-   Display in margins switches the text highlight for a more discret
    margin indication that an annotation is present at this line.
-   Do not display just hides any annotation mark (but does not
    deactivate the possibility to add annotations).

The combination of Instant mode and Quick create options let you use the
serial annotator mode as any selection will create an highlight without
prompting any pop up.
