# Accessibility {#a11y}

Thorium Reader is for everyone, including people who are blind or have
other types of visual, cognitive or motor disabilities. The application
is compatible with accessible technologies like screen readers,
including JAWS, NVDA, Narrator and VoiceOver. It includes a read-aloud
feature with visual highlighting. Thorium Reader can be used with the
mouse or the keyboard, and keyboard shortcuts are configurable. The
display can be customized to meet the needs of users, including colors,
text size, spacing, font and layout.

 warning
Attention !

The accessibility features are strongly dependant and affected by the
quality of the electronic publication files.

under the heading `Description` the content of the accessibility summary
metadata ( [accessibilitySummary]{lang="en"}).

Work is underway to develop a guide for displaying accessibility
information. We are following this work and will implement the
recommendations soon.

Accessibility information must be filled in by the editors. Thorium
displays this information as it was defined. In case of doubt or
complaint, please contact the distributor or the publisher of the file.

## Native accessibility functions {#a11y_native}

The native accessibility features offered by Thorium are strongly
affected by the quality of the read files.
