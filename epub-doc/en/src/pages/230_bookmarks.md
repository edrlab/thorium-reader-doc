# Bookmarking

## Add a bookmark

The <span class="ui_button">bookmark</span> button allows you to add a custom bookmark. 
A <span class="ui_button">bookmark</span> can be a fixed point or a text selection. 
Only one fixed point bookmark is possible per page 
(book pages or calculated pages in case there is not page reference in the book). 
But you can place as many texte selection bookmark as you want. 

When you add a <span class="ui_button">Bookmark</span> a notification appears to inform you that 
the <span class="ui_button">Bookmark</span> was *Added* or *Deleted*. 
The number just after indicates the total number of <span class="ui_button">Bookmarks</span> in the Book 
after this action. 

Select the text you want to mark.
Press the <span class="ui_button">bookmark</span> button
<img src="../../resources/images/bookmarkSingle-icon.svg" class="icon" role="presentation" alt=""/>
or the key combination  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>  +  <kbd>B</kbd>.

If no text is selected, the last known reading location will be marked.

## Reviewing and navigating the Bookmarks

Press the <span class="ui_button">Navigation</span> button (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>), then 
the <span class="ui_button">Bookmarks</span> button. You can change the name of each bookmark, delete 
bookmarks and move between bookmarks by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Access the list of bookmarks in the navigation area. Select the bookmark
you wish to access and press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. If you have
renamed the bookmark, it will be easy to go to several places in the book.

If you select a portion of text and then activate the <span class="ui_button">Bookmark</span> button, 
the bookmark created will have the selected line as its title.

If you have bookmarked a line without selecting a portion of text, try copying 
the line you are on in the clipboard.
Then go to the navigation options with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>,
then scroll down to the Bookmark section, where they are listed.
Press the <kbd>b</kbd> key to move to the edit button to 
rename the bookmark. Paste the line from the clipboard and press
<kbd>Enter</kbd>. This renames the bookmark with the line of text that you have
copied. When you have several bookmarks, this renaming of the bookmarks allows 
you to use them easily.

Since 3.2 it is possible to add Tags to bookmarks to ease filtering, grouping and finding specific locations.
