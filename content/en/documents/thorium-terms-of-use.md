Links to Other Sites or Resources
You may integrate in the Application links to third-party services or resources not operated by EDRLab, including Library data feeds. EDRLab has no control over such third-party sites or resources and is not responsible for their availability, security, Content or resources. The inclusion of such links does not imply an endorsement or a recommendation by EDRLab of the third-party service or resource in question. EDRLab is not responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with your use of or reliance on any Content, information, products, goods or services available on or through any third party service.

## Limitation of Warranty
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE APPLICATION AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, “AS AVAILABLE” AND WITHOUT CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION, FREEDOM FROM ERROR, ACCESSIBILITY, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, RELIABILITY, PUNCTUALITY, LEGALITY, PRIVACY, COMPLETENESS, SECURITY, QUALITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NO WARRANTY ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION OF YOUR COMPUTER EQUIPMENT OR MOBILE DEVICE AND SOFTWARE THAT MAY BE REQUIRED AS A RESULT OF VIRUSES, ERRORS OR OTHER PROBLEMS OF ANY KIND THAT YOU MAY EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION.

Without limiting the foregoing, EDRLab makes no representation as to the availability of the Books, the libraries’ compliance with lending conditions and the libraries’ compliance with the licensing conditions of the Books from the publishers, and cannot incur any liability in this regard.

## Limitation of Liability
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BRAND, ITS PARENT, SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATE COMPANIES AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, LICENSORS, LICENSEES AND ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “EDRLAB PARTIES”) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR INJURY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE APPLICATION OR THE CONTENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LAW ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR OPERATION OF THE CONTENT, THE APPLICATION OR THE INFORMATION ACCESSED FROM OR RELATED TO THE APPLICATION. THE PARTIES ASSUME NO LIABILITY, EVEN IF THEY OR ONE OF THEIR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SUCH DAMAGES MAY INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES OR INJURY RESULTING FROM ANY ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, LINE FAILURE, OR FROM ANY COMPUTER VIRUS, WORM, TROJAN HORSE OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENT.

Some applicable laws may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Therefore, some of the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. In all cases of exclusion, direct and indirect damage is limited to the price paid to obtain the right to use the Application.

You acknowledge that the EDRLab Parties have no obligation to monitor any Content accessible through the Application. However, you acknowledge that the EDRLab Parties have the right to monitor the use of the Application, at its sole discretion, and to disclose any information necessary to comply with any law, regulation or government request, in order to be able to operate the Application adequately or in order to protect itself or its users under the “Privacy Policy”.

## Compensation
You hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless the EDRLab Parties from and against any and all claims, actions or proceedings of any nature whatsoever and all damages, judgments, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses (including those incurred to enforce this provision), arising out of your use of the Application, the Content, any actual or alleged breach by you of these Terms of Use, or any violation by you of any applicable law or the rights of any other person or entity.

## Severability
If any provision of these Terms of Use shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The Terms of Use shall be construed to the greatest extent possible so as to give the closest possible effect to the invalid provision, within the bounds of legality.

## Absence of Waiver
The fact that EDRLab does not require the execution of any part of these terms of use does not constitute a waiver of its rights hereunder for past or future actions on the part of anyone.

## Applicable Laws and Jurisdiction
These Terms of Use and any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws in force in France, without reference to its conflict of law rules. Any action, suit or proceeding arising out of these Terms of Use (whether for breach of contract, wrongful conduct or otherwise) shall be brought exclusively in France, as the case may be, located in Paris, and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of these Terms of Use.
