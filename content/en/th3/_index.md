  <h2>Readium LCP DRM</h2>

  <p>
   Thorium Reader supports the
    <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/">DRM Readium LCP</a>,
    originally designed by the Readium Foundation. The
    <a href="https://readium.org/lcp-specs/">specification of this DRM
     is public</a>, and it is an ISO technical specification under the reference
    <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/79485.html">ISO 23078-2</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    LCP has already been adopted by many public libraries,
    universities and booksellers around the world (A
      list of
      <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/certified-apps-servers/">
      distributors supporting LCP is maintained here</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Publishing organizations around the world are 
    encouraged to adopt LCP as a means of protecting digital 
    books from over-sharing, while providing users with a 
    frictionless experience and keeping content 
    properly accessible. Please

    is interested in adopting LCP.
