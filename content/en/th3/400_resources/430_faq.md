<dt id="fullscreen">How can I enjoy Thorium in Fullscreen?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F11</kbd>  in a reader window, will toggle this window fullscreen. Note that this is different from the Zen mode available from the top right pictogram. Keyboard shortcut is the only way to go full screen.

</dd>

<dt id="manually_manage_files">Why can't I open an ebook without it being save in the Thorium Reader library?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Thorium, like several other ebook readers and reading systems stores imported publications in its own filesystem space, as this provides a guarantee that per-publication state and external metadata (e.g. bookmarks, settings, annotations, DRM status, etc.) can be reliably attached.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="PDFsupport">Why is there no read aloud nor annotations for PDFs?</dt>
<dd>EDRLab prioritises its work on offering a great experience to EPUB users. In Thorium Reader, advanced features like TTS and annotations are consequently available for EPUB first, and we expect that other app developers will get the best from PDF files. It does not mean that advanced features will never be available on PDF in Thorium, simply that our limited budget is used for what we consider best for ebook readers.

<dt id="PDFrotate">I accidentally rotated my PDF pages, how can't get it back?
</dt>
<dd>

The shortcuts for rotating PDF pages are:

* Rotate the document clockwise: r
* Rotate the document counterclockwise: shift + r

</dd>

<dt id="TTSvoices">I can't select the adequate voice for read aloud function (TTS)</dt>
<dd>Thorium uses the voices from the computer's operating system, in combination with the language information provided by the book.

* If you are using windows you can follow [Microsoft's guide Download the language pack for voice](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/download-language-pack-for-speech-24d06ef3-ca09-ddcc-70a0-63606fd16394). 
* If you are using Mac OSX the guide [Change the voice that the Mac uses to pronounce text](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-the-voice-your-mac-uses-to-speak-text-mchlp2290/mac).

Once the required voice is installed, Thorium will choose the voice corresponding to the language of the book.

It may happen that the book has the wrong language. In this case, Thorium allows you to change the voice to one that is present in the system via the Voice menu

<dt id="localStorage">How can I transfer the entire book collection from one machine to another?</dt>
<dd>
Having a UI for exporting the whole catalog is not a priority currently. 

The publications are stored in a well-known directory. 
  * on Windows10: C:\Users\ *user name* \AppData\Roaming\EDRLab.ThoriumReader\publications\
  * on MacOS: /Users/ *user name* /Library/Application Support/EDRLab.ThoriumReader/
  * on Debian: /home/ *user name* /.config/EDRLab.ThoriumReader/publications-dev/

In case of a migration from one computer to another or similar usecases, you can copy all ebook files in this repository and open them in the new installation of Thorium.
