<dt>EPUB</dt>
<dd>(Electronic PUBlication) is an open file format for electronic publications. 
EPUB is a native semantic format allowing to use numerous standardised languages such as HTML, ARIA, MATHML, SVG and others. 
The actual version 3 is known to provide the best up to date reading experience. Obsolete EPUB2 files are also readable in Thorium.

<dl>
<dt>DAISY</b></dt>
<dd>Usually produced and distributed by specialized libraries or NGOs, the DAISY format offers a significantly enhanced reading experience for ebooks that are not available in EPUB3. Thorium supports reading DAISY 3 and 2.02, both in their text only, audio only, and syncronised text and audio.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>PDF</dt>
<dd> despite a well-known lack of flexibility (no reflow option)
 and accessibility, many ebooks are still available in PDF only, especially
 in public libraries.

<dt>Audiobooks</dt>
<dd> a
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/"
>standardized format for audiobooks</a
 >
 has been designed by the W3C Publishing Working Group in 2020, and EDRLab
 was part of this WG. Thorium is supporting the
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf/">packaged (LPF)</a> audiobook format,
 which will soon be widely used by booksellers, or so we hope.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Visual narratives</dt>
<dd> EDRLab has designed a standard format for
 comics, manga, webtoons and other styles of digital works based on
 sequances of images.
 <a href="https://www.edrlab.org/open-standards/">Divina</a> is the name of
 this format. This is still an experimental format, and we hope that
 publishers will size it in 2021+.
