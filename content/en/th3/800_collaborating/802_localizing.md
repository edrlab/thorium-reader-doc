Thorium Reader user Interface localisation are provided and maintained thanks to volunteers and contributing organisations. 

Since february 2025 we use [Weblate project Thorium](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/thorium-reader/) as the main tool for localisation. For help, you can refer to the [Weblate Documentation](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/index.html). 

Alternatively, translations can be done directly through Github Pull request. This may be easier if you are familiar with local translation editors like [poedit](https://poedit.net/) that allows a less noisy translating environment and are documented to be used with screen readers. 
All locales are stored in the [sources resources locales folder](https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/tree/develop/src/resources/locales). 
    
For issues related to localisation, flag @gautierchomel in the comments.

## Contributors:
We maintain a list of contributors to properly credit theyre work, and also to help us who to mention in calls for translation. The list is non exhaustive, and we'll delete mentions on requests.
