EDRLab is a non profit developpement laboratory and places accessibility as a core requirement of it's actions. That include the developpement of Thorium Reader. 

However, the core aspect of innovation and experimentation of our work may affect accessibility at some points. 
Funding limitations may also affect our action and will to provide the best reading experience for all readers. 
These are the main reasons why we cannot, at this moment, afford a full accessibility testing cycle at each release. 

Any identified blockers are publicly informed and searchable via a dedicated Label [Accessibility on our Issue tracker](https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aaccessibility) that are treated as priority by the development team. 


## understanding all and each users’ needs

We capture feedback about customers’ experiences from an accessibility perspective thru different channels: 
    * Developpement [Issue tracker dedicated Label Accessibility](https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aaccessibility)
    * Email [contact form](https://www.edrlab.org/contact/) 
    * Indivdual feedback collected by our [members organisations dedicated to serving people with disabilities](https://members.edrlab.org/categories/serving-persons-with-print-disabilities/) 


## Thorium Reader accessibility features are informed

When an accessibility feature is introduced, we make that information public thru
* the version change log
* a short mention on the website landing page
* listed for reference in this website [ressources section, accessibility page](../../400_ressources/300_accessibility)
* all accessibility related explanations are available in the documentation, not in a separate chapter or place.

We are maintaining a [VPAT (voluntary product accessibility template) for Thorium Reader](https://rawcdn.githack.com/edrlab/thorium-reader-doc/4c82692352c92c2f3890522c16ce759689a181b8/content/en/th3/900_about_Thorium/903_thorium-vpat.html). 


## Support for assistive technology

A specific attention is given to non visual access thru screen readers. 

As much as possible we intend to maintain a similar access path between visual and non visual access. Whenever necessary, we use dedicated technologies like ARIA-Role.

New functionalities are tested with screen readers.

## Accessibility testing

Thorium EPUB accessible reading features are community testing thru [epubtest.org](https://epubtest.org/)
