EDRLab is a non-profit organization working on the development of open-source software, in particular on the Readium project and on Thorium Reader, a free and highly accessible reading application for desktop computers.

Because all software we create is free and open-source, and because developing reading apps is really complex, your sponsorship is needed. 

Easiest ways to participate in funding and sponsorship are:
* [Make a small recurring donation via Github Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/edrlab)
* [Enlist your organisation as an EDRLab member](https://members.edrlab.org/join/)

We are also glad to consider project based funding, for so, [contact us](https://www.edrlab.org/contact/)!
