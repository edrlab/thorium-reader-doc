You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> keys to access the 
search field. Enter your search term. By clicking on the 
`Search` button, you get `Back` and `Next` buttons to navigate between occurences.
The number of matches found is a link that will open a `List of results` 
in the right panel.
Each match displayed is a link you can Activate to go to the place 
of the book where the expression you are looking for was found.

{{< alert warning >}}

Remember that performing a search and navigating thru the results 
will make you loose the reading point you where at. 
Just place a Bookmark to make sure you find your way back.
