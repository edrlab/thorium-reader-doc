      <description>A book can be added to the library by opening it with Thorium from Windows Explorer or by importing it with the Import Book button. When a book is imported, it is copied and prepared in a reserved folder.
Thorium copies files in a publications subfolder of the EDRLab.ThoriumReader folder. The location of this folder may vary depending on the operating system and may be placed in a hidden folder, you will need to activate display hidden files option to find it.</description>

      <description>Many public libraries and bookstores are adopting OPDS as a standard format to display their catalog on the Web. Thorium can provide access to OPDS 1 and 2 catalogs. It also supports several identification formats associated with OPDS and can therefore provide users with access to their personal library, i.e. the digital books that the user has acquired or borrowed, allowing them to be downloaded and read immediately. When you are in the Thorium library, select the Catalogs tab then the button + Add an OPDS feed.</description>
