										<div class="implementing-section">
											<h5 class="implementing-heading"><a id="sc_111-i" name="sc_111-i"></a>Intent
												of Success Criterion 1.1.1:</h5>
											<p>Users with some disabilities can find a specific content element causes
												them physical pain (e.g. an image with high contrast) or distress (e.g.
												an image that triggers post traumatic stress disorder), or that the
												element's size can make the page difficult to use (because of difficulty
												scrolling, or shifting gaze, or moving the pointer more than a certain
												distance). In these cases the user needs to be able to hide that element
												or replace it with alternative content or a placeholder. Other users can
												find specific elements are simply unusable (e.g. an image that is too
												low contrast for the user's vision). In these cases the user needs to be
												able to access author-provided alternative content (e.g. alt text or
												longdesc) or the very minimum a placeholder (e.g. filename). </p>
											<p>Some users with disabilities need alternate languages or audio tracks
												(e.g. descriptive video). Users need the ability to choose tracks that
												best meet their accessibility needs (e.g. the caption track in their own
												language) when authors have provided many alternatives.</p>
											<p><em>Note:</em> If the user cannot directly select or choose the element
												in order to perform commands upon it (e.g. if the browser does not
												support clicking on HTML background images or moving focus to them with
												the keyboard), the user agent must provide an alternative user interface
												for this feature.</p>
										</div>

										<div class="implementing-section">
											<h5 class="implementing-heading"><a id="sc_111-e"
													name="sc_111-e"></a>Examples for Success Criterion 1.1.1:</h5>
											<ul>
												<li class="unclassified-ex">Rodney has low vision and finds some images
													on a web page are painful to look at. He can hide foreground images
													by right-clicking on them or pressing the Tab key to move focus to
													them, and then choosing a command from the element's context menu.
													However, the browser does not let him right-click or navigate to the
													background image. Therefore it provides a user preference setting to
													hide all background images or to hide the background image on the
													current site.</li>
												<li class="unclassified-ex">Carly has repetitive strain injuries and
													uses speech recognition to communicate with her computer. She's a
													paralegal and often has to search long documents for terms that are
													rendered as acronyms. It's often easier for her to speak full terms
													into the search box rather than acronyms because full terms are
													easier to say and better recognized, and this allows her to keep her
													vocabulary less cluttered by acronyms that can increase
													misrecognitions. She chooses a setting on her browser that
													automatically expands all acronyms and abbreviations before she does
													a search.</li>
												<li class="unclassified-ex">Laura has impaired vision and uses the
													shapes of words to help her recognize them easily. It is more
													difficult for her to read strings of seemingly random upper case
													letters than strings of familiar words written with only their
													initial letters capitalized, so she changes her preference settings
													to have all abbreviations replaced by their expanded strings.</li>
												<li class="video">Betty has an auditory processing problem. She is
													watching a movie that has several caption and audio tracks. She
													pulls up a menu to determine which tracks are available and switches
													between audio tracks until she find one she can understand. She also
													reinforces the audio by selecting a caption track.
												</li>
												<li class="video">Marka is blind. She is listening to a video of a
													lecture. The professor is demonstrating a chemistry experiment and
													is not speaking during a key portion of the video. Since Marka
													cannot see what the professor is demonstrating, she brings up a menu
													of the available tracks and discovers that there is an audio
													description track available. Marka selects the description track,
													skips back, and listens to the description of the experiment. </li>
												<li class="video">Gorges has profound hearing loss. He enjoys current
													run movies, and subscribes to a web service that streams major
													popular movies. Although he speaks English, he doesn't understand
													all the slang in the movie. He pauses the movie, selects a menu of
													caption tracks and finds a Spanish caption track. He watches the
													rest of the movie with Spanish captioning. </li>

											<p>Users need to be able to easily discover when authors have provided
												alternative web content that may be of interest so they can decide
												whether to have it rendered (see <a
													href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20-Reference/#sc_111">Success
													Criterion 1.1.1</a>). While the type of indicator is not prescribed,
												the success criterion requires that the indicator be placed along with
												the rendered content that has the alternative. This rules out indicators
												such as in the status bar, that don't clearly identify which content
												within a document has the alternative. Suitable indicators include
												outlines, adjacent icons, and adjacent links. As with any other feature
												of the user agent, the indicator itself must be accessible (e.g.
												keyboard accessible, alternative text, zoomable). </p>

										<div class="implementing-section">
											<h5 class="implementing-heading"><a id="sc_112-e"

											<ul>
												<li class="unclassified-ex">Chris is color blind. He doesn't use a
													screen reader or other assistive technologies, but sometimes has
													difficulty interpreting diagrams where the author has used color
													alone to convey meaning (e.g. to label lines). Therefore, Chris
													likes to read long descriptions when the author has provided them.
													To let himself know when long descriptions are available, Chris sets
													a setting in his browser that places a &quot;Description&quot; link
													adjacent to any image with a long description. Chris clicks the link
													the open the long description in a new browser pane. </li>
												<li class="unclassified-ex">Aosa is blind. When rendering a web page
													using synthesized speech, the user agent generates an audible tone
													to signify that the word being read is an acronym, and Aosa can
													press the * key to hear the expansion. When the phrase being read is
													the alt text for an image, another tone indicates that Aosa can
													press + to hear the long description.</li>
												<li class="mobile-ex"> Brin is deaf. The video player she is using has a
													button displayed beneath the playing video that indicates that
													captions are available. She clicks the button to toggle the captions
													on so she can understand the video. On her mobile phone, Brin
													touches a video, which displays the controls including the
													&quot;display caption&quot; control.</li>

												of Success Criterion 1.1.3:</h5>
											<p>Users may wish to hide images for a number of different reasons. Some
												users with cognitive disabilities may wish to hide images in order to
												avoid those that would be severely distracting. Some users with visual
												disabilities may wish to hide images in order to avoid those that are
												painful (such as those with high contrast). Other users may wish to
												replace images with alternative content because they are unlikely to be
												able to visually discern, understand, or otherwise benefit from the
												images. Some users with impaired motion or dexterity may wish to replace
												images with smaller alternative content to reduce the amount of
												scrolling they have to do, while some users with attention deficit
												disorder may wish to do the same thing in order to keep as much
												information visible on the screen as possible.</p>

											<ul>
												<li class="unclassified-ex">Tyler has a learning disability and finds
													images very distracting. He sets a preference in his browser to
													always display alternative text instead of an image. </li>
												<li class="mobile-ex">Ben has low vision and needs to use a very large
													font size to be able to read text. On his mobile device, enlarging
													the page makes any images so large that they use up too much screen
													space and require excessive scrolling. He sets a preference to
													render all images as text (if available) and to reflow the page so
													that the text flows smoothly with no space for the missing images.
												</li>
												<li class="unclassified-ex">Lee has low vision where text is blurred.
													She finds that the transparency effect that shows detail &quot;bleed
													through' under the window she is reading makes the text she is
													trying to read illegible. She sets a preference that hides all
													background images and transparency effects that the author may have
													written into a web page or application. </li>
												<li class="unclassified-ex">James has a reading disability where he
													needs text to be clear from
													distractions that are not related to the text. He configures his
													user
													agent to not load background images. Then when he navigates to a web
													page, James
													gets only the text from the web page without any images
													interfering with what he is reading.</li>
												<li class="unclassified-ex">Sasha requires high contrast to be able to

													her browser to turn off background images, so that she can see the
													text clearly without the variations in the background. </li>
												<li class="unclassified-ex">Matilda finds high contrast colors painful,
													and wants lower contrast font and background colors. She sets the

									<p>When alternative content is missing, it can be helpful for users to access
										metadata such as the filename, but not to have it be substituted as repair text
										for the missing alternative text. Because the metadata is not as useful as
										alternative content that's properly authored for the original document, the user
										agent should not interfere with the assistive technology attempts to repair. The
										assistive technology can provide users with information that can be more helpful
										than any one piece of repair text the user agent could provide. Therefore it's
										important that assistive technology have access to as much information as
										possible about the non-text content that needs repair, and also to be able to
										inform the user that no author-provided text alternative is available. User
										agents should provide assistive technology with available metadata for the
										non-text content that needs repair, but not substitute repair text in ways
										assistive technology will mistake for author-provided text alternatives. </p>
									<p>This is to avoid problems when (for example) the metadata in an image does not
										match the way it's being used on the current page. It allows a screen reader to
										distinguish between metadata provided by the page author, who knows the image's
										use here, vs. metadata tagging along from some long-ago source. For example,
										John is creating a web page that uses an image of a check mark for
										&quot;Selected&quot;. He grabs a PNG file from another site, not realizing that
										it's embedded IPTC TITLE attribute says &quot;You are a winner!&quot;. John is
										supposed to set alternative text for the image, but if he forgets to, it's
										better for a screen reader to say &quot;image, unknown&quot; than for the user
										agent to use inappropriate metadata substitution saying &quot;image, You're a
										winner!&quot;</p>

									<p>Users need to be able to easily discover web content they can interact with. One
										effective way to do this is to highlight enabled elements and links (including
										recently visited links). Highlighted selection and content focus lets people who
										use keyboard, gesture and speech input know where they are working. On some
										pages controls can be difficult to discern amid a large amount of other content,
										or can be styled so the controls are difficult to distinguish from other
										content. This can be particularly difficult for people with visual impairments,
										who may not be able to distinguish subtle visual differences. People with some
										cognitive impairments can have difficulty distinguishing between items with
										similar or non-standard appearance. Visually distinguishing these items reduces
										the amount of time or number of commands these groups require to examine a page.

											Jerry uses the dialog box to display the content focus outline so he can
											tell where the focus is on the page. </li>
										<li class="unclassified-ex">Binh gets easily frustrated when he cannot locate
											the buttons and links on a page. This happens when buttons and links don't
											have the standard appearance he's used to. The user agent provides a dialog
											box for setting overrides to author-selected link colors. Binh turns on the
											option to have all links appear in bright purple, and buttons drawn with a
											bright purple border so he can easily scan the page and find the items he's
											looking for. </li>
										<li class="mobile-ex">George has limited hand use and uses custom gestures on
											his mobile phone. He wants a visible focus indicator to know what element on
											the page has focus so when gestures are used on the mobile phone, he will
											know what element will be activated.</li>
										<li class="unclassified-ex">Aosa is blind. When rendering a web page using
											synthesized speech, the user agent generates an audible tone to signify that
											the word being read is an acronym, and Aosa can press the * key to hear the
											expansion. When the phrase being read is the alt text for an image, another
											tone indicates that Aosa can press + to hear the long description. </li>
										<li class="mobile-ex">Brin is deaf. The video player she is using has a button
											displayed beneath the playing video that indicates that captions are
											available. She clicks the button to toggle the captions on so she can
											understand the video. On her mobile phone, Brin touches a video, which
											displays the controls including the &quot;display caption&quot; control.

									<h5 class="implementing-heading"><a id="sc_141-i" name="sc_141-i"></a>Intent of
										Success Criterion 1.4.1:</h5>
									<p>Users with some types of disabilities have difficulty reading text as the author
										has formatted it. For example, some users with low vision, dyslexia, and related
										conditions and situations cannot read author-formatted text. However, they can
										read text that has a format customized to their individual needs (e.g. larger
										letters, different font, more spacing). Users with some cognitive disabilities
										and those who need to reduce the number of commands they enter to scroll through
										a document, may need to fit more information on the screen (e.g. smaller letters
										or spacing). Users need to access a wide range of
										font sizes, styles, colors, and other attributes in order to find the
										combination that works best for their needs. In providing preferences, it is
										important to avoid making assumptions. For example,
										some users can increase font size to make text more legible, while
										other users can reduce the font size to decrease the need to scroll the content.
									</p>
									<p>The relative size of text provides visual cues that help in understanding and
										navigating web content. Some content can be authored in a way that makes it
										difficult or impossible to understand when font distinctions are hidden, such as
										headlines that are in not in a larger font than body text. It's important that
										users who need to enlarge or reduce text size be able to preserve these visual
										cues. </p>
									<p>At a minimum, it is recommended to offer line spacing options of 1, 1.25, 1.5 and
										2.0. </p>

											background is white, it is hard for her to read and hurts her eyes. She
											changes the colors in her operating system to white text on a black
											background. However, many web pages specify their own colors, so she adjusts
											the user preferences in her browser to always use the system colors (or
											another set of colors of her choosing), regardless of how the pages are
											authored.
										</li>
										<li class="unclassified-ex"> Betty Sue has low vision from nystagmus and has
											difficulty seeing small fonts. The browser on her laptop provides five font
											sizes. However, the largest isn't big enough. The browser settings provide
											an option to override the five font sizes with customized font range, so
											that Betty Sue can select the specific font size she needs.</li>
										<li class="unclassified-ex">Mike has a reading disability. A website uses a
											fancy script font for the headings that he cannot understand. He uses his
											browser's font settings to select plain fonts that he can read.</li>
										<li class="mobile-ex">Ben has low vision. In the mobile settings dialog box, he
											chooses a large text for font size. All applications on the mobile phone
											display text in large font.</li>
										<li>Sebeeya has low vision. She finds text easiest to read at 16 pt Palatino and
											chooses to have her browser display body text in the 16 pt Palatino font.

										Success Criterion 1.4.2:</h5>
									<p>Some users with low vision, dyslexia, and related conditions and situations
										cannot read normally-formatted text. However, they can read text that has a
										format customized to their individual needs (e.g. larger letters, different
										font, more spacing). Users need to access a wide range of
										font sizes, styles, colors, and other attributes in order to find the
										combination that works best for their needs. In providing preferences, it is
										important to avoid making assumptions. For example,
										some users can increase font size to make text more legible, while
										other users can reduce the font size to decrease the need to scroll the content.
									</p>
									<p>Users who need large amount of screen magnification need to control the
										appearance of types of elements. For instance, a magnification of 300% can make
										headlines too large for display. Users need to be able to set the
										characteristics of element types (e.g. heading 1, heading 2, table heading) to
										make the web content readable. Magnification users who find that text size
										distinction greatly increases scrolling and fatigue also need to be able to
										display important elements such as headings (including table headings) and input
										fields independently from global settings. </p>
									<p>Many users with low vision have difficulty reading italic and underline and must
										be able to globally remove these styles. This can be accomplished with user
										stylesheets, but if the browser doesn't support user stylesheets, the browser
										needs to provide this ability through settings. Bold characters can
										&quot;bleed&quot; when characters are too close together which reduces
										readability for some.</p>
									<p>User stylesheets can be used where available. Users can control characteristics
										by element type, so that, for example, headings at the same level will have a
										similar appearance. </p>

									<h5 class="implementing-heading"><a id="sc_142-e" name="sc_142-e"></a>Examples for
										Success Criterion 1.4.2:</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>Tomas has low vision and uses a screen magnifier. He chooses to have his
											browser display all text the same size, and sets that size as large as he
											can without making the letters too tall for his screen. Tomas chooses not to
											have headings be proportionately larger than normal text because that would
											make them taller than his screen and so unreadable. He uses a user
											stylesheet to make the different levels of headings a different color. He
											makes the table headings bold so they stand out from the table text without
											significantly increasing the size. </li>
										<li>Adele is 84 and has macular degeneration and is experiencing fine motor
											problems. She loves using her mobile tablet to read her email and follow her
											grandchildren on social media. She has difficulty selecting text areas to
											enter forms. Her granddaughter helps her create a font size setting for
											input fields so that the text is larger and increases the area where she can
											tap, making it easier to enter text. </li>

										<li class="unclassified-ex">Wade has low vision and needs large text, extra line
											spacing, italics changed to regular font, and a muted background color in
											order to read. To make web pages readable, Wade uses a user stylesheet to
											change the way the headings are displayed. He makes the headings a little
											smaller than the main text, changes the font to Arial and red, adds space
											before and after the headings, and adds border above the headings. This
											ensures that headings aren't too big, navigation links don't break across
											lines as much, and a reasonable amount of text is visible at a time, so Wade
											doesn't have to do extra scrolling. By changing the heading elements to have
											a different appearance from the main text, Wade can easily distinguish
											headings without them being them too large. </li>

										<p>Calculating font height and base character width can be complicated. For

											<li class="unclassified-ex">Suzanne's vision has deteriorated due to aging
												and she has had cataract surgery. When she reads blocks of text that

												skim or track from the end of one line to the next. In one browser she
												uses a toolbar that doubles the line spacing. For another browser, a
												friend coded a bookmarklet that Suzanne uses to double the line spacing.
											</li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Abdullah has dyslexia and low vision, and has
												trouble telling letters and words apart. When he increases the character
												spacing and word spacing he can better distinguish each letter and
												understand the words. When text is underlined, such as links, it makes
												it hard for him to read, so he turns off underlining.</li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Jamee has dyslexia that makes it hard for her to
												keep her focus on words. When text is fully justified, there are
												sometimes lots of space between words and in long paragraphs of text,
												these create &quot;rivers of white&quot;. She sees the spaces and has
												trouble focusing on the words. When Jamee changes from full
												justification to left justification, there is normal space between words
												and she can read much more easily with less fatigue.</li>

										<p>The ability to print content is important for users who have difficulty
											reading or interacting with web content directly in the user agent due to
											software, hardware, or ergonomic issues. Printing to virtual printer devices
											can also be a necessary step in converting the content to another electronic
											format that the user finds more accessible. It is also important that the
											user be able to print content with modifications they have applied, such as
											scaling or highlighting, or else they can find the printed version unusable.
											At the same time, they need to be able to have content reflowed to fit the
											width of the page, or else content may be cut off.</p>
										<p>User agents are strongly encouraged to let the user print a portion of the
											document, such as a selection or specified range of pages, because otherwise
											printing won't be a practical option for long documents. </p>

											<li class="unclassified-ex">Ansgard has multiple sclerosis that causes low

									<p>Some people find that it easier to read when text is displayed using a specific

										While some requirements are most common (such as larger text), the combination
										that works best will vary from one individual to the next. They will typically
										want these setting applied to both user interfaces and rendered content. On many
										platforms the user can adjust platform preference settings to meet their needs,
										and these settings are available to applications such as user agents. Each
										applications can then provide a simple user option to follow those settings,
										rather than make the user repeat the configuration process in every application.
										Likewise it means that if their needs change, or they discover settings that
										work better for them, they can make that change in one place rather than
										repeating it over and over again. This also makes it easier for the user to
										maintain a consistent presentation across all their applications. If the user

									<p>Mechanisms exist to allow users and authors to customize the rendering of web

										web content accessible to a wide range of user needs. These success criteria
										ensure that users can take full advantage of this ability to customize
										stylesheets. Since different websites may require different style changes to be

										Success Criterion 1.7.4:</h5>
									<p>Stylesheets provide for powerful customization of rendered content. Occasionally
										a user may need to make slight modifications to the author-supplied external
										stylesheets used on a website to satisfy certain accessibility needs. At other
										times a web author may have created a stylesheet that a user with a disability
										finds helpful. The intent of this success criteria is to allow users to easily
										save the stylesheet for a website and make needed modifications without having
										to create full stylesheet of their own and to apply well designed stylesheets to
										other web pages where they find the stylesheets helpful. While it is customary
										for authors to
										compress stylesheets and scripts to save load time, it would be highly
										beneficial if the user agent saved the stylesheets in a format that
										facilitates reading and editing by users (e.g. without stripping out line
										breaks). </p>
									<p>Stylesheets can be difficult to make sense of. UAAG realizes that most users will
										want to use a tool to read and edit the stylesheet. It is recommended that tools
										or add-ons are supported for making stylesheets easier to use for less technical
										users. Many low vision users require custom stylesheets for accessibility and
										better support for user stylesheets will improve the browsing experience for
										these users. </p>

										<p>A user has many ways to input information into a computer or device,
											including mouse, keyboard, gesture, and speech. The keyboard paradigm is the
											most universal interface for text input &ndash; even devices that do not
											have a keyboard (like mobile phones) support a software interface for them.
											A user should be able to navigate, read and use all of the web page or
											application without needing to use a mouse. Some users do not use a mouse.
											Others can only use a pointing device that uses the keyboard API. It's
											important that these users be able to interact with enabled components,
											select content, navigate viewports, configure the user agent, access
											documentation, install the user agent, and operate user interface controls,
											all entirely through keyboard input. User agents generally support at least
											three types of keyboard operation:
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Direct (e.g. keyboard shortcuts such a "F1" to open the help menu; see
												checkpoint 11.4 for single-key access requirements)</li>
											<li>Sequential (e.g. navigation through cascading menus)</li>
											<li>Spatial (e.g. when the keyboard is used to move the pointing device in
												two-dimensional visual space to manipulate a bitmap image)</li>
										</ol>
										<p>User agents should support direct or sequential keyboard operation for all
											functions. The user agent should offer a combination of keyboard-operable
											user interface controls (e.g. keyboard operable print menus and settings)
											and direct keyboard shortcuts (e.g. to print the current page).</p>

													<li class="unclassified-ex">Select content and operate on it. For
														example, if it is possible to select rendered text with the

											<li class="unclassified-ex">Amal has a medical condition that prevents him
												from using the mouse. He is reading a web page where the author used the
												CSS overflow property to constrain the size of a block of content.
												Amal's browser provides scroll bars to display text that overflows the
												viewport. He uses the keyboard to enter the element and operate the
												scrollbars to read all the content, he then uses the keyboard to return
												focus to the main web page. (see <a
													href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20-Reference/#sc_213">2.1.3 No

												the comments below the video player.</li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Cade has low vision. He can't identify an icon
												and so he needs to read its alternative text. Mouse users could hover
												the mouse over the icon and have its alternative text displayed as a
												pop-up or tooltip, but Cade cannot use a mouse. He uses the keyboard to
												move focus to the icon. The browser automatically displays the
												&quot;hover&quot; tooltip, or allows him to press a key to have it
												displayed.</li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Jeremy is a speech-input user who cannot use his
												hands to control his computer. It is much easier for him to speak
												keyboard shortcuts then click on an icon in a new program. He needs to
												be able to see tooltips to discover keyboard shortcuts without having to
												use the mouse. </li>
											<li class="mobile-ex">Karen has muscular dystrophy and cannot easily use the

											<li class="unclassified-ex">Amal has a medical condition that prevents him
												from using the mouse. He launches a web browser and navigates to a web
												page that has an enabled edit field. The browser places the keyboard
												focus on the edit field so Amal can immediately start entering text, and
												its location is shown using a text cursor (usually a vertical line or
												I-beam). As he types, the text cursor moves to show where the next
												character will appear. If Amal activates another window, the browser may
												hide the cursor in the now inactive window, but its location is still
												available to assistive technology. </li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Raymond has low vision. As the keyboard focus
												moves from one control to another, or one window to another, his screen
												enlarger utility detects the focus change and pans its viewport to keep
												the focus location visible. </li>

										<p>People do not expect side effects when moving the keyboard focus regardless

											cannot see changes happening elsewhere on the screen. Users may also find it
											confusing or disorienting if the effect causes unexpected focus movement or
											changes in context. If the user agent does implement side effects to
											keyboard navigation, it is recommended that it provide a user preference
											setting to disable them. However, in some cases it may be more appropriate
											to provide a separate navigation mechanism that avoids side effects, such as
											allowing the user to hold down the Ctrl key while navigating to avoid
											changing selection or choice.
											Note: It may not be possible for the user agent to detect or prevent side
											effects implemented by scripts in the content, but the user agent is
											required to prevent side effects that are under its control.<br />

										<p>Sequential keyboard navigation is a fundamental, universal method of keyboard
											access. While it can be slower and require more input than other methods
											(such as direct, structural, or search-based navigation) it is a simpler
											mechanism that requires very little cognitive load or memorization, and is
											consistent across contexts. Users need keyboard access to all viewports and
											all enabled elements so that they can manipulate them, view them with screen
											magnifiers, or have them described by screen readers. The ability to move
											both forward and backward through the navigation order greatly reduces the
											number of keystrokes and allows the user to more easily recover from

											should proceed every time they press navigation keys. This is a particular
											problem for users with some cognitive limitations or whose disability makes

										<h5 class="implementing-heading"><a id="sc_235-i" name="sc_235-i"></a>Intent of
											Success Criterion 2.3.5</h5>
										<p>People using a keyboard interface need the ability to remap the user agent's
											keyboard shortcuts in order to avoid keystroke conflicts with assistive
											technology, reduce number of keystrokes, use familiar keystroke
											combinations, and optimize keyboard layout (e.g. for one-handed use). This
											is important for people with dexterity issues where every keystroke can be
											time consuming, tiring or painful. It is also important for people using
											assistive technologies such as screen readers, where many keystrokes are
											already in use by the assistive technology. The goal of this success
											criterion is to enable the user to be in control of what happens when a
											given key is pressed, use the keyboard commands that meet specific needs,
											and save the modifications.</p>
										<p>Content authors can use the Accesskey attribute to define shortcut keys that
											allow quick access to specific elements, actions, or parts of the web
											content. The author can select shortcuts that are different from what the
											user expects. Users who rely upon keyboard input may want consistent
											shortcut keys across the sites they visit. </p>
										<p>Users should have the option to make any keyboard shortcuts be persistent
											across browsing sessions. The user should be able to save, import and export
											these settings.</p>
										<p>User agents can also offer the user the option to automatically apply
											preferred key combinations for content that has author-specified accesskey
											bindings that are based on the associated text, label, or ARIA role. This
											overrides any author-specified keybinding. </p>
									</div>

									<div class="implementing-section">
										<h5 class="implementing-heading"><a id="sc_235-e" name="sc_235-e"></a>Examples
											for Success Criterion 2.3.5:</h5>
										<ul>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Frank has repetitive strain injuries and uses
												speech input. He has defined standard commands to access commonly used
												parts of a website. For example, when Frank says &quot;site
												search&quot;, the cursor jumps to the search field. If the author has
												assigned an access key that is not standard, Frank can override it and
												set the access key to a standard mapping so he can say the same search
												command across all the sites he uses. </li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Laura types with one hand and finds keys on the
												left side of the
												keyboard easier to press. She browses to a web page and notices that
												the author has assigned access keys using keys from the right side of
												the keyboard. She opens a dialog in the user agent and reassigns the
												access keys from the web page to the left side of the keyboard. She also
												uses the user agent's preference settings to redefine its keyboard
												shortcuts in the same way. </li>
											<li class="mobile-ex">Laura types with one hand. On her mobile device, Laura
												maps common website actions to numeric shortcut keys. For example, she
												prefers to have the 1 key to activate a site's search function. An
												author of a site visited daily by this user defines &quot;S&quot; as the
												accesskey for the search function. Laura overrides the author-specified
												accesskey of &quot;S&quot; with &quot;1&quot;. </li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Elaine has low vision and is using a screen
												magnification program. The program uses Alt+M to increase the
												size of the magnified area of the screen. She notices that in her web
												browser, Alt+M is a access key for activating a home button that stops
												her
												from being able to control her magnification software. She opens a
												access key reassignment feature in the user agent, and sets Alt+O to be
												the new access key for the home button. Her screen magnification
												software
												now works correctly.</li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">George uses a screenreader. The screenreader
												uses Ctrl+F to read the item with focus. Since this is a common user
												agent command for Find, the user agent allows George to reassign the
												Find command to a non-conflicting key binding. The user agent provides a
												list of user interface features and default keyboard assignments with
												options for the George to assign new key combinations. George saves the
												user keyboard customizations the same way he saves other user
												preferences.</li>

										<p>Users with disabilities may not be able to use a user agent in a particular
											configuration. This can occur during setup when default settings don't meet
											their needs, or after someone changes an option. If users cannot change the
											settings from the user interface, they need a way to adjust or reset those
											options from outside the user agent. The user agent can accomplish this in
											multiple ways including detecting and implementing the platform
											accessibility settings, providing an external file to modify, providing
											access to settings from a separate utility program, providing accessibility
											options in the installation program, or providing command-line switches to
											change the user agent's behavior. </p>
										<p><em>Note: </em>User agents are encouraged to allow all user preferences to be
											adjusted. </p>

									<div class="implementing-section">

										<ul>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Aosa is blind. Her web browser is incompatible
												with her screen reader unless she changes one of the browser's advanced
												settings. Because she cannot activate and use the appropriate dialog box
												until the setting is changed, she needs to start the browser using a
												dedicated command-line switch that changes the behavior.</li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Bintu is deaf and enjoys watching captioned
												videos. Since different video players may not have accessible settings,
												she sets her browser to always display captions, knowing the video
												player will respect the browser's request to display captions. In this
												way the options in one user agent (the embedded video player) are set
												outside its user interface by being set in another program (the hosting
												browser).</li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Sasha requires high contrast to be able to
												discriminate the shape of letters. She has set the accessibility
												preferences on her computer to use high contrast mode. When she launches
												her browser, it detects that she is using high contrast and adjusts the
												font and color settings for its user interface to reflect those
												settings. </li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Justin has an attention deficit disorder. He is
												setting up his new e-book reader and is interrupted while setting the
												default font colors. He accidentally sets his background and font color
												to white on white. He can't read the settings screen to recover his
												default settings, so he exits the reader and follows the instructions on
												the vendor's website to edit the "settings.ini" file to adjust the
												colors. He restarts the reader with the corrected color settings. </li>
											<li class="mobile-ex">Jan is easily confused by new interfaces. Using the
												screen reader capabilities on her mobile phone she changes the interface
												of the updated browser, then can't figure out how to undo them. She uses
												an app from the browser developer to reset the browser settings to
												default.</li>

										<p>The user needs to control which user interface elements are visible and

										<p>This can reduce keystrokes, bring buttons into view that are hidden by
											default or otherwise allow the user to interact with the user agent in a
											more efficient fashion. Users with dexterity impairments or mobility
											impairments can have problems making the large movements required to select
											between non-adjacent controls which they need to use frequently. Similarly,
											users with low vision can have to move their magnified view-port excessively
											to see frequently used controls. Enabling these controls to be situated
											together removes some of the strain faced by these users, and increases
											productivity as task completion times are decreased. </p>

										<ul>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Martin accesses the computer by pressing keys
												with a stick held in his mouth. He gets around the user agent with taps
												on the tab and arrow keys. The button for printing a web page is the
												last button on a toolbar. This button requires six presses of a right
												arrow key. This is the only button Martin uses on the toolbar. Using a
												preferences dialog, Martin is able to configure this toolbar to only
												show the Print button, reducing the number of time he must press with
												his mouthstick. </li>
											<li class="mobile-ex">Laura has one hand. When she holds her mobile phone in
												her left hand, she must use her thumb to press the controls. She
												configures her mobile apps so that the toolbars are at the left side or
												the bottom, so she can reach them. </li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Caraway has a repetitive strain injury. She uses
												speech input. The
												speech program automatically clicks toolbar items that she speaks. In
												programs she uses a lot she removes toolbars that she doesn't use in
												order to reduce the probability that the speech program will interpret
												text
												input as a toolbar command and click something Caraway does not intend.
											</li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Zelda has a brain injury that leaves her easily
												confused. She reorders
												the toolbars in her web-based word processing and layout programs so
												that the text color and highlight color icons are in the same order and
												she can rely on habit to click the correct button no matter what program
												she is in. Without this ability to reorder she finds herself constantly
												clicking the wrong button because they are configured differently by
												default in the different programs.</li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Devon is easily distracted. In programs he uses
												frequently, he removes
												toolbars he does not use in order to cut down on distractions. </li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Sally has memory issues that make it difficult
												to memorize keyboard
												shortcuts. She has aligned the keyboard shortcuts in several programs
												so she doesn't have to memorize as many shortcuts.
												She reminds herself of keyboard shortcuts by hitting a
												key that gives her a list of keyboard shortcuts in the current program.
											</li>
											<li class="mobile-ex">Linda has rheumatoid arthritis and finds it difficult
												to perform the
												pinch gesture that's commonly used to zoom on mobile phones. She changes
												the default gesture for zooming to a gesture she can more easily do.
												Linda's left hand is less damaged than her right hand. She moves a
												common control from the right side of the screen to the left side of the
												screen to make it easier to access with her left hand.</li>
											<li class="mobile-ex">Jennifer is blind. She sometimes configures apps on
												her

										<p>Users who

											controls provided for playing media need to be able to load media in a
											paused state. The user agent provides a global control that
											sets a state equivalent to "paused waiting for user interaction" for
											all recognized media when a page loads. The user has a global option to set
											autoplay to off or paused until the
											user activates &quot;play&quot;. The user agent provides a visual
											or auditory indicator that the video is in paused
											state and needs user interaction to start. This prevents media from
											playing without explicit request from the user.</p>
										<p>When the media is not in the actual document, but rather has
											been created with document.createElement('audio'), the
											user agent does not recognize that the media exists and cannot give a visual
											indication by default. In this case, it
											is up to the author to provide the controls. See WCAG in resources

										<p>Users with various disabilities benefit from spell checkers. The ability to
											check spelling is particularly important for users with disabilities such as
											dyslexia that significantly increase the likelihood of misspelled words.
											Spellcheckers also alert blind and low vision users to errors in text entry.
										</p>
										<p>Spell checking is only expected in editable text in content, most commonly
											text input controls and form fields. It is not required on text input fields
											that are part of the UA user interface, such as an address bar or File Open
											dialog box. Spell checking is also not required on static, read-only, or
											disabled text elements, controls, and fields in content, except when they
											display text the user can edit indirectly (e.g. static text that the user
											can alter using nearby buttons), or when the user agent is in an authoring
											mode that allows the user to edit text that would otherwise be static. </p>
										<p>Spell checking should be available regardless of how the text was entered.
											For example, text can be entered by the user typing, pasted from the
											clipboard, initialized by the content (e.g. the HTML value attribute), set
											programmatically by scripts or assistive technology, or filled in by a
											feature of the user agent itself (e.g. auto-complete). Spell checking which
											highlights unrecognized words as they are entered is preferred over
											requiring the user to use a separate tool or editing pass. Spell checking
											should be optional, so that it can be avoided by users who find it too
											distracting, or for whom the highlighting makes the text less legible. </p>
										<p>Note: It is recommended that user agents also provide assistance with
											grammar, as well as spelling. Grammar can pose more difficulty than spelling
											for people with some cognitive disabilities or whose native language is
											signed. </p>

										<p>Users need to know that navigation in a web page is going to start in a
											predictable location and move in a predictable fashion. If a page moves the
											initial focus to somewhere other than the beginning of the page, the user
											can skip over content without realizing it. If the focus moves and remains
											unnoticed, users can make unintentional changes, such as entering data in an
											incorrect field. Focus changes can cause a window to scroll unexpectedly,
											confusing users. This is particularly problematic for users who can only see
											a small portion of the document, because they must use more effort to
											determine where the cursor has moved. Such users also are more likely to
											continue typing, not immediately realizing that the context has changed.
											Users who find navigation time consuming, tiring, or painful (including
											those using screen readers or with impaired dexterity) can also need more
											steps to return to the area where they want to work. It can improve
											accessibility for some users on some pages to have the page set focus to
											specific links or fields when the page loads, but this can be detrimental
											for other users, and therefore users need to control this behavior. </p>

												to limit the number of keyboard and mouse entries he makes each day,
												because it is painful. He loads a page that has its default focus in a
												search box. Jerome wants to read the content of the page, rather than
												search. This requires him to make additional clicks to get to the
												content of the page. He intends to use this page frequently, so he
												adjusts his browser's settings to disable the automatic focus change to
												prevent the extra clicking in the future. </li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Jessica uses a screen enlarger. She loads a page
												that contains instructions followed by a form. If the page automatically
												moves the keyboard focus to the form, she may not realize there were

												phrase. </li>
											<li class="unclassified-ex">Joey is blind and uses a screenreader. She is
												filling in a web form that asks for her phone number using three
												separate fields. When she types the three digits of her area code into
												the first field, the browser automatically moves the focus to the second
												field. Because Joey does not realize that the focus has moved for her,
												she presses the Tab key to move it manually, not realizing that this now
												puts the focus on the third field rather than the second. To avoid this
												problem, Joey goes to her browser's Preferences dialog box and checks
												the option that prevents focus changes that she has not explicitly
												requested. </li>

											Success Criterion 4.1.1:</h5>
										<p>Platform accessibility services provide common functionality across the
											well-behaved applications running on the platform. This reduces exceptions
											that assistive technology has to implement for the hundreds of applications
											it may need to support. Most major operating environments provide platform
											accessibility services that allow applications to work with assistive
											technologies. These platform accessibility services must be supported by
											both the user agent and the assistive technology. Specifics of what
											constitutes a platform accessibility service will differ on each platform,
											but basic features common to these services are addressed by other success
											criteria under Guideline 4.1.</p>
										<p>Most web-based user agents support this requirement automatically because
											they run inside host user agents. The host is responsible for exposing all
											content, including nested user agents, via platform accessibility services.
											As long as the nested user agent's user interface is entirely web-based and
											complies with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (e.g. providing
											alternative text and supporting WAI-ARIA where needed) the host will
											understand it well enough to provide a bridge between the content and
											platform accessibility services. </p>

										<ul>

											<li>Role (purpose, such as alert, button, checkbox)</li>
											<li>State (current status, such as busy, disabled, hidden)</li>

												text box, the position number of a slider, the date in a calendar
												widget)</li>
											<li>Focus (has focus, focusable)</li>
											<li>Selection (selected, selectable)</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Every component developed for the user agent must pass this information to
											the appropriate accessibility platform architecture or application program
											interface (API). Embedded user agents, like media players can pass Name,
											Role, State, and Value via the WAI-ARIA techniques. Since not every element
											supports every property, follow the platform accessibility services
											convention for cases where an element type does not support one of the
											listed properties. <br />

										<p>User agent user interfaces that are not web applications need to be

											have the flexibility to conform with the appropriate accessibility
											guidelines or legislation for their platform or markets.</p>
										<p>The user should be able to easily discover detailed information about the

											be able to do so without installing and testing the accessibility features.

												section states: &quot;Show current input focus clearly at all times.
												Remember that in controls that include a scrolling element, it is not

							<ol type="a">
								<li>Name and manufacturer</li>
								<li>Version of key software components (e.g. operating system, other software

								<li>Hardware requirements (e.g. audio output enabled, minimum screen size: 2&quot;,

								<li>Operating system(s) (e.g. Windows, Android, iOS, GNOME)</li>
								<li>Other software environment (Java, Eclipse) </li>
								<li>Host web browser when the conforming user agent is web-based (e.g. JW Player on

						<li><strong>Platform Limitations:</strong> If the platform (hardware or operating system) does
							not support a capability necessary for a given UAAG 2.0 success criterion, list the success
							criterion and the feature (e.g. a mobile operating system does not support platform
							accessibility services, therefore the user agent cannot meet success criterion 4.1.2). For
							these listed features, the user agent can claim that the success criteria do not apply (see
							10.b.1 following). </li>
						<li><strong>Web Content Technologies:</strong> List the web content technologies rendered by the
							user agent that are included in the claim. If there are any web content technologies
							rendered by the user agent that are excluded from the conformance claim, list these
							separately. Examples of web content technologies include web markup languages such HTML,
							XML, CSS, SVG, and MathML, image formats such as PNG, JPG and GIF, scripting languages such
							as JavaScript/EcmaScript, specific video codecs, and proprietary document formats. </li>
						<li><strong>Declarations:</strong> For each success criterion, provide a declaration of either
							<ol type="a">
								<li>whether or not the success criterion has been
									satisfied; or </li>
								<li>declaration that the success criterion is not applicable and a
									rationale for why not, from the following choices:
									<ol>
										<li><strong>Platform</strong>: not applicable due constraints of the platform,
											per Paragraph 7 above (e.g. color handling on a monochrome device, video
											handling in a purely audio browser, or interprocess communication on an
											operating system that does not support multitasking). Describe the specific
											platform limitation. </li>
										<li><strong>Input</strong>: not applicable due to a constrained input set (e.g.
											a help system that only displays the HTML files included with the product)
										</li>
										<li><strong>Output</strong>: not applicable due to intentionally limited output
											modalities (e.g. video handling in a browser that only does audio output,
											even though the platform can support video)</li>

					</summary>
					<p> This option can be used for a user agent add-on or plug-in with
						limited functionality that wishes to claim UAAG 2.0 conformance. An
						add-on or plug-in can claim conformance for a specific success
						criterion or a narrow range of success criteria as stated in the claim.
						All other success criteria can be denoted as Not Applicable. </p>
					<p>UAAG
						recognizes that some add-ons can be so specialized to the needs of a
						particular disability that the add-on is mutually exclusive with
						other success criteria of UAAG, but the goal would be for add-ons to
						work with the user agent so that any features of the user agent needed
						for UAAG conformance are not broken by one add-on. If the add-on
						limits other accessibility features of the user agent, then include a
						statement to that effect, such as: "This add-on breaks success criterion
						x.x.x because it is intended to meet [foo] need
						of [this] class of user." An example would be a (hypothetical) add-on that breaks 1.8.2 and
						1.8.3 (viewport navigation) to provide a simplified page for people with high distraction
						levels. </p>
