        <!-- <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>
            Effective navigation is a critical aspect of digital accessibility.
            Users often face challenges in understanding where they are within a
            digital publication or application and how to move seamlessly
            between sections. For example, screen reader users, who access
            content sequentially through synthetic speech or braille displays,
            rely on navigation features to rapidly and efficiently orient
            themselves and access content efficiently. Readers with learning
            differences benefit from clear navigation structures, well-defined
            headings, and consistent cues. Understanding and addressing these
            user requirements is key to creating inclusive digital experiences
            that empower all users to navigate content independently and with
            ease.

            When displaying the table of contents, the focus must be on the

            publication’s table of content comprises a hierarchy of entries
            (e.g. volumes, chapters, subsections) then it must be presented as a
            tree view, nested list view or any other view that conveys the
            structure to the user. The user must have a mechanism to move
            between items in the table of contents of the same level
            (e.g. between the chapters without having to go via the
            subsections).

            Page numbers or percentage information could be provided in the

            a digital publication, for example, after following an internal
            link, reading a footnote or reference, jumping to a search result,
            or accessing a glossary entry.
   <br/>
            While some screen readers offer limited navigation history, an
            in-app “go back” function provides a more predictable and
            user-controlled experience, and benefits users who do not use screen
            readers as well.

            exposed within the app. To support navigation by headings, blocks,
            lines, words, and characters, the content must be properly
            structured and tagged so that the screen reader can interpret and

            images, and other semantic elements must be exposed to the screen
            reader so that it can be interpreted by the screen reader. Where
            present, the semantics of links—such as whether they are
            bibliographic references or footnotes—should be made available to

            <td>
                Note: In this document the term “embedded audio” refers to the
                audio content (could be human narrated audio or generated
                text-to-speech) that is provided as part of the publication.
                This is distinct from read aloud, where the app dynamically uses
                on device or cloud TTS to create an audio rendition whilst
                reading the publication.
            </td>
        </div>
        <td>
            Embedded audio includes both audio-only publications and
            synchronized audio-text formats, where the audio is aligned with
            the visual text. Audio-only formats are a long-standing favorite
            among people with print disabilities, offering a streamlined,
            immersive listening experience. They are also increasingly
            popular in mainstream contexts, such as for multitasking or
            screen-free reading.
        </td>
        <td>
            Synchronized audio-text formats offer additional benefits by
            enabling users to follow the structure of the text while
            listening. This supports a wide range of reading strategies—for
            example, allowing users to navigate the text with assistive
            technologies, adjust playback speed or verbosity, or combine
            listening with reading for improved comprehension and control.
            Although this functionality is not yet widely supported in
            reading systems, it holds great potential for inclusive and
            flexible reading experiences.

        <td>
            This section outlines the core user requirements for interacting
            with embedded audio, including playback control, synchronization
            with text, visual emphasis, and customization. These features
            ensure that users can access high-quality narration in a way
            that aligns with the structure and intent of the publication.

            the same point—is not yet addressed and remains an area for
            future development.

            audio files as defined by the publication. In synchronized text
            and audio formats, the playback order must be determined by the
            markup that links text and audio, ensuring that the spoken

            When embedded audio is synchronized with text, the user must be
            able to see the relevant text, and the display must
            automatically update to keep the spoken text in view. The
            techniques for changing the text in display might include
            scrolling the text to keep the text being read in the center of
            the display or displaying a new screen of text and starting
            again at the top. Keep in mind that some users may use large
            text settings, so it's important to consider that they might not
            see the entire first or last sentence.
<br/>
            The user should be able to see the text being read. If starting
            from the top of the display then the audio playback should start
            from the first visible text in view (that is, should not read
            text that is not visible). The display should promptly update to
            always show the text being read, even if this is partway through
            a sentence at the bottom of the display.
<br/>
            The user could have the ability to move to a different part of
            the text whilst the playback continues. If viewing a different
            part of the text, the user should be able to initiate the
            playback from a part of the text they select.

            The user could have the option to listen to the audio without
            displaying the text.

            Flexible display options in a reading app are essential for people
            with print disabilities, especially those with low vision or

            text and images — including font type, size, color contrast,
            spacing, and margins — significantly improves readability and
            comfort. These adaptations reduce visual stress and cognitive load,
            making it easier for users to process and understand content. By

            The amount of line spacing (leading), word spacing (space between
            words) and letter spacing (space between letters/characters) impacts
            readability. People have different space requirements for reading

        <td>
            Justification impacts readability and tracking. Fully justified text
            creates uneven spaces between words and letters, leading to “rivers
            of white space” that disrupt reading flow and visual tracking,
            particularly for people with dyslexia. Users with low vision who
            rely on screen magnifiers may encounter exaggerated gaps or
            overlapping characters in justified text, making it harder to read.
            Center-aligned text is also problematic for multi-line blocks, as it
            disrupts smooth reading flow and makes it harder to find the
            beginning of lines. Depending on the reading order of the language
            concerned (left to right, or right to left) turning the
            justification or center-alignment off results in a left-aligned or
            right-aligned text.

            Having wide margins results in shorter line lengths. This may be
            useful for individuals with certain learning disabilities. Wide
            margins around paragraphs can make it easier for some individuals to
            concentrate on the main text and avoid distractions from surrounding
            content.

<br/>
            Some people need high contrast between text and background,
            including many older people who lose contrast sensitivity from
            ageing. Some individuals prefer reading dark text on a light
            background. Others find it easier to read with low contrast and
            colors that present less glare.
<br/>
            For some people, common color combinations or colors from a limited
            color palette work fine, for example, black text on white background
            or the inverse with white text on black background. For instance,
            black text on a white background is specifically useful for people
            with dyslexia. Other people need to select more specific background
            and text colors. For example, people who need low brightness
            overall, need to select the specific background and text colors that
            provide sufficient contrast for them yet not too high brightness.
            Readable and optimal color combinations differs vastly among
            individuals and can even vary for one individual depending on

            Learners with print disabilities can face significant challenges
            when completing exercises in books: if they are unable to read or
            write in physical books, they are often required to write their
            answers into a word processor, which can be time-consuming and
            mentally draining. The ability to input answers precisely where
            questions or prompts appear in the digital content makes the
            experience more intuitive and less fragmented.

            independently. Accessibility features such as screen reader
            compatibility and the ability to save and edit responses are
            essential for an inclusive and seamless user experience.
            Additionally, synchronization and export options provide greater
